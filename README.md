# Hacktoberfest Issue Mirror

Note: This repo has no real content, other than this README. It simply mirrors `#hacktoberfest`
tagged issues to make them discoverable. This guide should help you get started making your
first PR to our repositories!

## Background

Puppet uses [Jira](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com) for most of our issue tracking. This has the
unfortunate side effect that the [Hacktoberfest filters](https://github.com/search?utf8=âœ“&q=label%3Ahacktoberfest&type=Issues)
won't pick them up. This repository mirrors issues so that you can find them. You should use the
Jira links to get back to the actual ticket to find more information about it or to file your PR.
